Church window cookies are a rolled cookie that is cut into rounds. The marshmallows are colored and look a bit like church window panes. You can use either crushed nilla wafers, graham crackers, or coconut flakes for the outer coating, they all taste great.

#####You need:

* Knife
* Plastic wrap
* Bowls
* Spoon

#####Ingredients:

* 1 pound semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 bag miniature colored marshmallows
* 1 tsp. vanilla flavoring
* 1 stick butter (1/2 cup)
* either 1/2 bag sweetened flaked coconut, graham crackers, or nilla wafers, crushed

#####Procedure:

1. In the microwave, melt the butter and chocolate chips together in a bowl, being careful not to overheat

2. Mix the butter and chocolate well, beating with a spoon until it is well mixed. 

3. Add the vanilla and mix well

4. Pour the marshmallows into a new bowl and pour the chocolate mix over it. Fold together

5. Spread a sheet of plastic wrap on the counter and sprinkle 1/4 of the coconut or other coating over it.

6. Spoon 1/2 of the marshmallow mixture onto the plastic wrap, on top of the coconut, forming a log shape.

7. Sprinkle 1/4 of the coconut on top of the log and roll in the plastic wrap, pressing firmly into a log and twisting the ends of the plastic wrap to secure. 

8. Repeat with the rest of the marshmallow mixture and coconut to create a new cookie log.

9. Chill for about an hour, slice and serve! They won't last long.

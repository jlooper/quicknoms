Blanching and then sauteeing green beans is an old restaurant trick. Even though it's a two-step process it's still quick and easy. It creates the perfect texture: tender beans that don't dry out. This version uses microwave-in-bag green beans, so you only have one pan to wash.

The fragrant toasted pepper makes this SO much more than simple buttered green beans, even though the ingredients are the same.

#####You need:

* Microwave
* Skillet
* Wooden spoon

#####Ingredients:

* 1 package microwave-in-bag green beans
* 2 Tbsp Butter (or more, to taste. be bold.)
* Fresh-ground pepper, to taste (but add more than you think you need)
* Salt (if you like fancy sea salts, this is a good place to use them.)

#####Procedure:

Puncture the bag of green beans to allow steam to escape as they cook. Microwave on high for 3 minutes. (Alternatively: cook according to the package directions, subtracting 1-2 minutes from the cooking time.) The green beans should be nearly cooked: bright green, but still but quite firm, and they should still "squeak" against your teeth when you bit into one. 

Remove the green beans from the microwave bag, draining any excess liquid.

Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and pepper. Stir occasionally as the butter melts, allowing the pepper to lightly toast and become fragrant. 

When the foam on the butter is mostly gone, add the green beans to the butter. Cook another 2-4 minutes, or until they reach the desired tenderness. (If this goes too slowly, you can turn the heat up to medium-high.) Salt to taste.

#####Tips:

* The toasted pepper is what makes this dish so snappy. So don't skip the toasting step, and add it generously! As my Auntie Josie used to say (in another recipe) "when it looks like you have too much pepper, double it!"

* You can use loose green beans instead of the microwave-in-bag kind. Trim the beans, then cook them in rapidly boiling water for about 4 minutes, and drain. Then proceed as written.

Simple and easy and just right for a night of study

#####You need:

* Pasta pot or medium-sized stock pot with lid
* Extra bowl
* Wooden Spoon

#####Ingredients:

* Any type of uncooked pasta
* 1/4 pound ground lean beef or turkey
* Small jar red sauce
* Optional grated parmesan cheese

#####Procedure:

1. Brown the ground meat in the pot over medium-high heat.

2. With the lid just open over the top of the pot, drain the oil from the meat away when the meat is entirely brown.

3. Put the meat back on the stove and add the red sauce. When it is hot and bubbling, spoon the sauce into the extra bowl.

4. Rinse out the pot and fill halfways with water. Bring water to a boil

5. Add the pasta. Depending on the kind of pasta used, cooking times will vary. Make sure to keep stirring the pasta while it cooks so it won't stick together.

6. When pasta is soft and plump, drain the water out of the pot, using the same technique as you used with the meat

7. Pour the sauce over the pasta

8. If you like cheese, shake some parmesan over the top

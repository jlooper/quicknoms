Pizza bagels are easy and filling. Make some now, freeze some for later in a zip-lock bag. In the video, we don't use bagels but rather purchased pizza dough - either is fine!

#####You need:

* Toaster oven
* Knife

#####Ingredients:

* Plain bagels
* Red sauce (pizza sauce or other marinara-type sauce as you prefer)
* Shredded mozarella cheese
* Pepperoni (pre-cut is easiest to deal with)
* Optional extras, like some mushrooms or green pepper strips

#####Procedure:

1. Cut the bagels in half and lay side by side

2. Spread the red sauce onto the bagel halves, not using too much

3. Sprinkle with shredded cheese

4. Cover with pepperoni and other optional toppings

5. Toast in toaster oven for 5 minutes or until cheese bubbles.
